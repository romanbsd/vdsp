# vdsp
Port of Apple's [vDSP](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vdsp?language=objc) Accelerate framework to Android.

It only includes a small subset of the original framework,
as I was only implementing the functions I needed to port my DSP
code from iOS to Android.

For FFT you can use [ne10](https://github.com/projectNe10/Ne10),
or implement your own adapter.

Pull requests are welcome.
